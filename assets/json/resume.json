I collavorated with colleagues from INFN-CNAF on the design, development with an IaC approach, and implementation of a PaaS-type architecture as a pilot for the European competence center for cultural heritage (activity carried out within the 4CH project). I actively collaborated in the integration and porting of the THESPIAN suite into the 4CH PaaS. Since 07/2022 I have been responsible for digital development and co-author of the AIRES-CH (Artificial Intelligence for digital REStoration of Cultural Heritage) project, written in collaboration with the PI Dr. Francesco Taccetti, and with the head of Scientific Analysis Dr. Chiara Ruberto. The AIRES-CH project was the winner of the Tuscany Region call Giovani Sì - FSC Research Grants Year 2021, CUP I95F21001120008. The AIRES-CH project focuses on the development of a native cloud application based on deep neural networks to perform the task of automatic color assignment to imaging analyzes with nuclear technologies, in particular X-ray fluorescence analysis. I personally followed the design, writing, training and testing of neural networks, as well as data recovery, dataset creation and data engineering. The code for the development of the neural networks was written in Python, exploiting packages for numerical calculation such as NumPy and SciPy, with the TensorFlow and Keras packages for the architectures, and with the Optuna package for the optimization of the hyperparameters through the Bayesian optimization. Finally I worked on the design, development and release of a server application with REST API architecture to serve trained neural networks via the web. The code for the REST-API is released on GitHub.","highlights":["Deep Learning","Cloud Computing","Computer Vision"]},{"name":"Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare","position":"Assegnista di Ricerca","url":"https://home.infn.it","startDate":"2020-09-01","endDate":"2022-06-20","summary":"I deal with research and development of digital infrastructures and web services for the Digital Heritage Laboratory (DHLab) of the Cultural Heritage Network (CHNet), National Institute of Nuclear Physics, Florence, within the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) European research projects ) - Pillar (https://www.eosc-pillar.eu/), and ARIADNEplus (https://ariadne-infrastructure.eu/).","highlights":["Deep Learning","Cloud Computing","Computer Vision","Full-stack development"]}],"education":[{"institution":"University of Padova","location":"Padova, Italy","url":"https://www.unipd.it/","area":"Doctor Europaeus certificate.

Fuzzballs are String Theory solutions that approximate the usual Black Hole (BH) at large distances but are otherwise smooth geometries without curvature singularities or a causal disconnecting horizon. If all BH microstates were described by fuzzballs, the infamous BH information paradox would de facto be solved.","studyType":"PhD, Physics","startDate":"2016-10-01","endDate":"2019-09-30","score":"Excellent","courses":[]},{"institution":"University of Florence","location":"Firenze, Italy","url":"https://www.unifi.it/","area":"Physics (LM-17).

From the technological point of view, one of the purposes of the presented use case, is to build a demonstrator to validate the high rate analysis infrastructure provided by WP5 has the capability to support a wide range of different scientific domains. The proposed infrastructure aims to support the paradigm shift from a batch-based approach to an interactive analysis model based on a parallel processing possibly over geographically distributed backends.","highlights":["Distributed Computing","Nuclear Vision","Deep Learning","Spectral Vision"],"startDate":"2023-09-11","endDate":"2025-08-01","url":""},{"name":"Artificial Intelligence for digital REStoration of Cultural Heritage - AIRES-CH","summary":"","highlights":["Nuclear Vision","X-Ray Fluorescence","Deep Learning"],"startDate":"2021-07-01","endDate":"","url":""}]}
