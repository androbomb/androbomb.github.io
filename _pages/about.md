About Me: 
I began my research activity during my master's, dedicating myself to the study of theoretical aspects in black hole physics. During the three years of Ph.D. I conducted research in the context of Theoretical High Energy Physics. I continued my research moving to the University of Stockholm, where I work for three months as a project assistant.

Currently, I work as a Researcher at the INFN in the network devoted to the application of nuclear techniques to Cultural Heritage, the so-called Cultural Heritage Network (CHNet), where I am responsible for the research and development of digital infrastructure and web services for the CHNet's Digital Heritage Laboratory (DHLab), within the EU projects European EOSC-Pillar, Ariadne+, and 4CH.

I am also the Responsible of the Digital development and ideator of the Artificial Intelligence for digital REStoration of Cultural Heritages (AIRES-CH) project, funded by a grant of Tuscany Region; AIRES-CH aims at building a web-based app for the digital restoration of pictorial artworks through Computer Vision technologies applied to nuclear imaging raw data. Two papers were already published about AIRES-CH.

I currently works as a technologist at the INFN Florence section, within the National Center 1 - ICSC National Research Center in High Performance Computing, Big Data and Quantum Computing, within the Spoke 2 "Fundamental Research", WP2 "High Energy Physics" and WP6 "Industrial Applications & Space Economy"
